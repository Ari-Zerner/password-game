# Claude Code Session Notes

## Current Feature: Password Guessing Game
 **COMPLETED**

### Feature Description
Created a simple web app for a password guessing game with the following functionality:
- Enter a password locally which gets hidden
- Password is replaced with empty input boxes (one per character)
- Each box can be typed in to guess characters
- Correct guesses are highlighted in green with success styling
- Incorrect guesses are shown with error styling (red border)
- Real-time progress counter shows correct/total guesses
- Completion message appears when password is fully guessed
- New Game button to reset and start over

### Implementation Details
- Used React hooks for state management (password, gameStarted, guesses)
- Implemented character-by-character validation with case-insensitive matching
- Added keyboard navigation (auto-focus next input, backspace navigation)
- Styled with Tailwind CSS and daisyUI components
- Responsive design with card layout and proper spacing
- Clean, intuitive interface with lock icon and clear instructions

### Key Features
- **Password Input Phase**: Enter password (hidden with type="password")
- **Game Phase**: Individual character input boxes with validation
- **Visual Feedback**: Green for correct, red for incorrect guesses
- **Progress Tracking**: Badge showing current progress (X / Y correct)
- **Completion**: Success alert with emoji celebration
- **Reset Functionality**: New Game button to start over

### Technical Architecture
- Single page application using TanStack Router
- Component separation: HomePage and PasswordGuessGame components
- Proper TypeScript interfaces for props
- React refs for input focus management
- Controlled components with proper state updates

### Commits Made During Session
- Initial implementation of password guessing game functionality
- Made password input plaintext and changed branding to "Password Game"
- Removed all authentication UI and router devtools - clean interface with only game functionality
- Added instruction panel and updated to sexy dark gradient color scheme with pink/purple accents
- Updated README to describe the password game project instead of template boilerplate

### Testing Completed
- Manual browser testing verified all functionality works correctly
- Password entry and game start flow
- Character guessing with visual feedback
- Completion detection and celebration message
- New game reset functionality

### Next Steps/Extensibility
The code is structured to easily add future features like:
- Hints system
- Multiple difficulty levels
- Timer/scoring system
- Multiplayer functionality
- Different game modes
- Statistics tracking
